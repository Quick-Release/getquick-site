# The publication events' real-CMS proof: generates a disposable content site
# from this checkout's blueprint, installs its Frontend's and its CI Worker's
# npm dependencies (the latter for Wrangler's local workerd runtime), sets up a
# real WordPress (the version the CMS skeleton pins, on SQLite, with WP-CLI)
# carrying the site's own event and delivery-retry mu-plugins and the public
# WPGraphQL plugin (for gq site check's CMS readiness), then runs
# cms-events.mjs: WordPress publishes through its real hooks, and the Frontend
# built by Alchemy's Astro Cloudflare build, served in workerd with a local D1
# publication store, receives the signed events.
#
# The site installs @getquick/site from this checkout, not npm
# (this-checkout.sh). Generation stays offline and secret-free; only the
# downloads (npm packages, WordPress, its SQLite integration, WPGraphQL and
# WP-CLI, cached in GQ_SMOKE_CACHE) use the network. Nothing is provisioned or deployed: no Cloudflare account,
# token, remote resource or live CMS is used. The site is deleted afterwards
# unless KEEP=1. Needs php and unzip. The real-cron check runs only when
# Docker has the image GQ_SMOKE_CRON_IMAGE (default ddev/ddev-webserver:v1.25.4,
# which DDEV installs) locally; it is never pulled.
