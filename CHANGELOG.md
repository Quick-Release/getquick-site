# Changelog

All notable changes to `@getquick/site` are recorded here. Versions follow
[Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/); each release is tagged `v<version>`.

## 0.1.0 — 2026-09-30

First release: `gq-ops` 0.1.0 (`Quick-Release/gq-ops@d972d12`) as the `gq` bin
of `@getquick/site`.

### Added

- `run(argv, { cwd, env, fetch, exec, stdout, stderr })`, the in-process entry
  point behind `gq`. It resolves to the exit code; commands read no
  `process.env` or `process.cwd()`, and every provider request and child
  process goes through the injected `fetch` and `exec`.
- A fixture-site test harness (`test/support/fixture-site.mjs`): a temporary
  Git repository with a `gq.ops.json`, and recording `fetch` and `exec` fakes.
- `pnpm release:publish`, which publishes a tagged version with `NPM_TOKEN`
  from Sigillo.

### Carried over from gq-ops, unchanged

- `gq context show`, `gq ploi …` (including all 225 `ploi api` operations),
  `gq cloudflare …`, and `gq github actions sync`, with the same forms, output,
  and `gq.ops.json` discovery.

### Changed

- Without `XDG_CONFIG_HOME` or `HOME` in `env`, no machine `gq/ops.env` is read.
- Ploi requests identify as `getquick-site/<version>` instead of
  `gq-ops/<version>`.

### Removed

- `gq credentials configure`, which wrote provider tokens to `.env`; sites
  inject them per command from Sigillo instead.
- `gq test post-deploy`, which only ran a site's own `pnpm gq test post-deploy`
  script.
